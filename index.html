                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p> In the heart of a bustling city, a group of friends, united by their shared concern for the
                    environment, found themselves grappling with a unique challenge - how to raise awareness about the
                    silent threat of ocean acidification. Determined to make a difference, they decided to channel their
                    passion into action.<br><br>

                    Late one night, during an animated brainstorming session, someone proposed the name "pHighters." The
                    wordplay on "pH," which represents the acidity level, and the phonetic similarity to "fighters"
                    struck a chord. It perfectly encapsulated our mission to combat ocean acidification. The name
                    "pHighters" became more than just a clever play on words; it embodied the spirit of the team's fight
                    against an invisible enemy threatening the oceans.<br><br>

                    As we delved into our work, the name became a rallying cry for the group, resonating with the
                    broader community. "pHighters" became synonymous with a collective effort to raise awareness,
                    innovate solutions, and fight for the health of the oceans - a name that not only reflected our
                    mission but also inspired others to join the cause.</p>
